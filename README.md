AutoResearcher is an open-source project that uses GPT-based AI models to automatically generate academic literature reviews based on a given research question. The script fetches top papers from the Semantic Scholar API, extracts relevant information, and combines the findings into a concise literature review.

The project is a very early prototype and is still under development. The vision is to create a tool that can conduct actual scientific discovery on autopilot.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eimenhmdt/autoresearcher.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
cd autoresearcher
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate` instead of `source venv/bin/activate`.

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a .env file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key and an email of your choice (used to identify your API requests for getting citations):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
EMAIL=<your_email>
```

Replace <your_openai_api_key> with your actual API key from OpenAI.

## Usage

Run the script with your research question as a command-line argument:

```bash
python main.py -q "<your_research_question>"
```

Replace <your_research_question> with your desired research question. Providing a research question is mandatory; otherwise, the script will show an error message and exit.

The script will fetch the top papers, extract answers, and generate a literature review.

### Optional: Output Literature Review to a Text File

If you would like to save the literature review to a text file, you can pass an optional command-line flag -o followed by the output file name:

```bash
python main.py -q "<your_research_question>" -o literature-review.txt
```

This command will save the generated literature review to the specified file, in this case, literature-review.txt.
